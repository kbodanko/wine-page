**The heart of the project:**
Functions, functions and one more time css:)

**Project describe:**
My project of vineyards website. I focus on aesthetics, good user experience and convenient solutions. And a little bit of animation. Comfortable menu showing up dynamically and the 'back to top' arrow. The page allows to collapse and expand some content. Content for repeating elements (menu options, articles, images) is added dynamically. Fully responsive.

**Project objective:**
To test comprehension of JavaScript objects and object-oriented constructs and  to get some practice with using objects and object-oriented techniques in a real world context.
