**The heart of the project:**
Functions, functions and one more time css:)

**Project describe:**
My project of vineyard website. I focused on aesthetics, good user experience and convenient solutions. And a little bit of animation. Comfortable menu showing up dynamically and there is a 'back to top' arrow. The page allows to collapse and expand some content. Content for repeating elements (menu options, articles, images) is added dynamically used a loop. Fully responsive.

**Project objective:**
Creation of a smooth, user-friendly website.

**I learned and/or practised while writing the project:**
- The beginnings in graphics (my first logo :))
- Experiments on various items and how to implement it (background video, 'filling' menu fields)
- A lot of css - grid, animation, media query
